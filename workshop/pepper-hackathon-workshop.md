# Prerequisite

1. download and install [cf client](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli)

2. download and install [git client](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

3. apply bluemix account 

If you don't have bluemix account, you can follow the steps in this [link](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/cloud/library/cl-bluemix-fundamentals-start-your-free-trial/) to create one. 


Once login, set your region to US South:

# Install latest humix-think

## Step 1: Clone
You can run Humix Think either on bluemix or run it locally. 


First, clone the repository to your local machine

```
git clone https://github.com/project-humix/humix-think.git
```

## Step 2: Config
The first step is to pick a name for your application. So enter the think directory and modify the manifest.xml

command:
```
    cd humix-think
    vim manifest.yml
```
 
update the `name` and `host` properties. Make sure the name is unique, otherwise the process will fail when trying to deploy on bluemix. 


example manifest.yml : <br>
``` 
applications:
- path: .
      memory: 256M
      instances: 1
      domain: mybluemix.net
      name: humix-pepper
      host: humix-pepper
      disk_quota: 1024M
      services:
      - Humix-Cloudant-Service
      - Humix-Conversation-Service
      - Humix-Speech-Service
      command: node --max-old-space-size=384 app.js --settings ./bluemix-settings.js -v 
 ```


## Step 3. Deploy

commands
```
cd humix-think
./deployThink.sh
```

example output
```
    API endpoint: https://api.ng.bluemix.net
    Email> liuch@tw.ibm.com
    Password>

    Authenticating...
    OK
    Targeted org liuch@tw.ibm.com
    Select a space (or press enter to skip):
    1. dev
    2. demo
    3. personal
    
    Space> 1

    Targeted space dev
    
    API endpoint:   https://api.ng.bluemix.net (API version: 2.40.0)
    User:           liuch@tw.ibm.com
    Org:            liuch@tw.ibm.com
    Space:          dev
    Creating service instance Humix-Cloudant-Service in org liuch@tw.ibm.com / space dev as liuch@tw.ibm.com... 
```
  if everything works well, you can find your application in the following link (change your application name)

# Build the brain

## getting start with NodeRed

there are many good resource in this area, including : [NodeRed Developer Guide](http://developers.sensetecnic.com)

## understand 'sense event' and 'sense command'

1. Use `humix-diaload-module` to receive speech-recognition result
    - use __sense event__ to receive events generated by the robot
        * pick sense ID
        * pick module name
        * pick events associated with the module
    - use __sense command__ to trigger commands on robot
    - use __sync sense command__ to trigger command synchronously (e.g. ask cam module to take a picture)
        * pick sense ID
        * pick module name
        * pick events associated with the module

2. Use `humix-qi-proxy` to start behaviors on robot, as well as much more additional function to add


## use Watson Conversation Tool
1. define intent
2. define entities
3. design dialog
4. use conversation node in nodered
    - copy the workspace_id from conversation tool.

## build API for robots

1. /say
2. /surprise
3. /thinking
